# ikt's Pretty Realistic Handling Pack

This pack contains handlings made for various GTA V vehicle mods,
which are tuned to achieve the highest degree of realism possible in GTA V.

Several scripts (of mine) are required to get every facet of the handling
correct.

Included:

* [1994 Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R V-Spec II by y97y](https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/nissan-skyline-gt-r-bnr32)
  * Folder: [`y97y-BNR32`](y97y-BNR32/README.md)
* [2004 Subaru Impreza WRX STI by AlperB](https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-2004-add-on-tuning)
  * Folder: [`AlperB-subwrx`](AlperB-subwrx/README.md)

Each folder has a readme with further elaboration on how the numbers were
correlated with real-life stats.
